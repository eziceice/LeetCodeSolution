## Step to run this project locally

### Steps
1. Clone and check out this project in your local (**Intellij prefer**).
2. **If you don't have any lombok error then you can ignore this step**
If you have some lombok issue (**IDE related**), this can be fixed by **enable annotation setting** and **add lombok plugin**. Follow this [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24006937/lombok-annotations-do-not-compile-under-intellij-idea) to resolve this issue. 
3. Build project, find **MainApplication.java** and run it.
